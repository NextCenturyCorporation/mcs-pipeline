# Deploy Files 

The files in this directory are deployed to EC2 machines.  They 
have performer-specific code to run the MCS code for a single scene.

The appropriate file should exist in /home/ubuntu on the EC2 machine.

## Shared Code

The performer-specific script calls shared code to reduce maintenance, using
source.  These should also be in /home/ubuntu.
